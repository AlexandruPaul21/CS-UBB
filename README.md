# Faculty repository

My name is Alexandru-Paul Sirbu, and I am a computer science student at Babes-Bolyai University in Cluj Napoca's Faculty of Mathematics and Computer-Science.

This repository houses all of the projects I've completed for university up to this point. I cannot guarantee that they are 100% correct, but I did my best.
